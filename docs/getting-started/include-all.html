<p>Yes. See the <a href="../../docs/server/your-server.html">deploying to your own server</a> guide for more info.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="s-Can I use Deployd without the JavaScript library? (e.g. for mobile apps)-216"></a><h3>Can I use Deployd without the JavaScript library? (e.g. for mobile apps) <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Can I use Deployd without the JavaScript library? (e.g. for mobile apps)-216">#</a></h3>

<p>Yes, you can use Deployd as a JSON API <a href="../../docs/collections/reference/http.html">over HTTP</a>.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="s-Can I use Deployd with front-end frameworks like Backbone, AngularJS, Ember, Knockout, etc?-216"></a><h3>Can I use Deployd with front-end frameworks like Backbone, AngularJS, Ember, Knockout, etc? <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Can I use Deployd with front-end frameworks like Backbone, AngularJS, Ember, Knockout, etc?-216">#</a></h3>

<p>Yes, Deployd is unopinionated on the front-end and you can use any libraries that you like. For frameworks that provide their own AJAX implementation (particularly Backbone), you should probably use the <a href="../../docs/collections/reference/http.html">HTTP API</a> rather than dpd.js in most cases. Dpd.js is still useful for realtime and user authentication, as most of those frameworks don't provide any built-in way to do this.</p>

<p>If you're interested, some of Deployd.com (such as the community page and the documentation's search feature) was built with <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and certain parts of the Dashboard (such as the data and property editor) were built with <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>. </p></div><div class="section"><a name="s-Is Deployd anything like [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/)?-216"></a><h3>Is Deployd anything like <a href="http://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>? <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Is Deployd anything like [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/)?-216">#</a></h3>

<p>Yes and no. Deployd is often compared to Meteor, since they are similar in several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>They're both open source frameworks useful for building rich front-end web apps.</li>
<li>They both simplify backend or API development.</li>
<li>They both provide realtime functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, they are different in a few significant ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deployd creates APIs that can be used by web apps, mobile apps, and other web servers. Meteor, at the time of this writing, focuses exclusively on web development.</li>
<li>Deployd provides a dashboard to let you define collections and manage data. Meteor simply exposes the MongoDB API. </li>
<li>Deployd is unopinionated on the front-end, letting you use whatever libraries you're familiar with; or no libraries at all. Meteor's realtime templating system unifies back-end and front-end development, but it dictates how you write your front-end code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Deployd and Meteor solve many of the same problems in very different ways. You should try both frameworks to see which one better meets your needs.</p>

<p>In the future, the two frameworks may not be mutually exclusive. Deployd focuses on data management and business logic while Meteor focuses on front-end rendering in real time; it may be possible to integrate the two for the best of both worlds.</p></div></div>  

      
        

    

      
        

  <div class="section"><a name="s-What is Deployd?"></a><h2>What is Deployd? <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-What is Deployd?">#</a></h2><div class="section"><a name="s-Deployd is a tool that makes building APIs simple by providing important ready-made functionality out of the box that meet the demands of complex applications.-1472"></a><h4>Deployd is a tool that makes building APIs simple by providing important ready-made functionality out of the box that meet the demands of complex applications. <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Deployd is a tool that makes building APIs simple by providing important ready-made functionality out of the box that meet the demands of complex applications.-1472">#</a></h4></div><div class="section"><a name="s-Configuration should feel like creation-1472"></a><h3>Configuration should feel like creation <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Configuration should feel like creation-1472">#</a></h3>

<p>In a tool like Deployd, where its purpose is to provide ready-made functionality, a lot of configuration is necessary to make sure the end result behaves the way you need it to. We didn’t want to send users to a configuration file, though. That’s not inspiring, and it’s tedious. When you’re making an app, it should feel like you’re creating something, not just selecting values.</p>

<p>Some frameworks bypass this by allowing you to configure the app with code. In Deployd, you might have created your API by writing a class that inherits from a Collection base class. This is better than writing configuration files, but ultimately it leads to a lot of boilerplate code. In a Convention Over Configuration environment, when you want to use the default functionality, you write an essentially empty file. When you want to override the default functionality, you write everything from scratch.</p>

<p>Our solution is the Dashboard. Simply put, it’s a web-based IDE for Deployd configuration files. It’s an expressive interface that lets you create your app’s API visually.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="s-Logic should be code-1472"></a><h3>Logic should be code <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Logic should be code-1472">#</a></h3>

<p>Though we didn’t want to have our users write code for the structural setup that’s better handled in a custom interface, we realized that we can’t have users add business logic in this way. Business logic is different for every app, and we can’t account for every use case.</p>

<p>At the same time, we can’t force business logic out of the server-side and onto the client; that would leave your app open to attack by people who figure out your API.</p>

<p>We decided that there’s no better way to define logic than by writing code, so we made Deployd scriptable. By writing events, or hooks into the default functionality (such as creating objects, updating them, and querying them), you can create almost any app with any rules: validation, security, query optimizations, relationships, and more.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="s-An API Engine-1472"></a><h3>An API Engine <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-An API Engine-1472">#</a></h3>

<p>We call Deployd an <strong>API Engine</strong> - because we think its closest relative is actually a video game engine.</p>

<p>A game engine assumes that every game has levels (or maps, or rooms, or scenes) which contain game objects, which need to be rendered to the screen and interact with each other. Most engines have a level editor, where you can build up these levels without any programming or code generation; when you’re finished with your level, it’s not exactly a playable game, but it works and you can walk around in a map that you built - this is the creation over configuration principle in effect.</p>

<p>Similarly, Deployd assumes that every API you build has <a href="../../docs/collections">collections of data objects</a> which need to support CRUD operations, (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Collections are created in Deployd's version of a level editor called the dashboard.</p>

<p>Continuing with the analogy, a game engine also knows that your game will need things like collision detection and movement, but it doesn’t know exactly how you want to implement that, so it allows you to write scripts at strategic points like “on collision” or “on tick”.  </p>

<p>How a rocket is rendered to the screen is pretty consistent for any game, but what happens when that rocket hits an enemy is always different, so you write the latter behavior as a short script, and the game engine runs it at the right time. This strategy spares you from boilerplate without taking away the power and flexibility of writing custom code.</p>

<p>In Deployd, the low-level, redundant parts are routing and database access, so those are built into the core and you don’t have to worry about them. Business logic, which is different for every app, is scripted in <a href="../../docs/collections/adding-logic.html">Events</a> - hooks into the CRUD operations.</p>

<p>For some people, this isn’t the right approach for a final app; they prefer to have full control over the backend to tweak the performance and low-level functionality as they see fit and feel uncomfortable being limited to business logic. (Many game developers choose not to use a game engine and prefer a lower-level rendering library for virtually the same reasons) In those cases, we recommend Deployd as a prototyping tool rather than a full backend framework.</p>

<p>For the developers who prefer to spend their time building user interfaces, though, the scriptable engine approach is liberating. </p></div></div>

    &lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also add a file <code>script.js</code> and paste this code:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    $('#comment-form').submit(function() {
        //Get the data from the form
        var name = $('#name').val();
        var comment = $('#comment').val();

        //Clear the form elements
        $('#name').val('');
        $('#comment').val('');

        addComment({
            name: name,
            comment: comment
        });

        return false;
    });

    function addComment(comment) {
        $('&lt;div class="comment"&gt;')
            .append('&lt;div class="author"&gt;Posted by: ' + comment.name + '&lt;/div&gt;')
            .append('&lt;p&gt;' + comment.comment + '&lt;/p&gt;')
            .appendTo('#comments');
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>Run the app:</p>

<pre><code>$ dpd --open
dpd&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>open</code> command will automatically open <code>http://localhost:2403</code> in your browser.</p>

<p><img src="../../tutorials/first-app/images/comments-app-preview.png" alt="App Preview" title="" /></p>

<p>This basic app asks for a name and message body to post a comment. Take a moment to read the code and see how it works. </p>

<p>Next, we'll add a Deployd backend to this app, so that users can interact with each other and post comments.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="s-Creating a backend-3475"></a><h3>Creating a backend <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Creating a backend-3475">#</a></h3>

<p>Open the dashboard by typing <code>dashboard</code> into the <code>dpd&gt;</code> prompt. </p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new Collection Resource and call it <code>/comments</code>.</li>
<li>On the Properties editor, add two "string" properties called <code>name</code> and <code>comment</code>.</li>
<li>In the Data editor, add a couple of comments so you can start testing right away.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all you have to do in the backend for now!</p></div><div class="section"><a name="s-Integrating in the frontend-3475"></a><h3>Integrating in the frontend <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Integrating in the frontend-3475">#</a></h3>

<p>In <code>index.html</code>, add the following script reference in between jQuery and <code>script.js</code> (near line 37):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/dpd.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will add a reference to <a href="../../docs/collections/accessing-collections.html">dpd.js</a>, a simple library dynamically built specifically for your app's backend. Dpd.js will automatically detect what resources you have added to your app and add them to the <code>dpd</code> object. Each resource object has asynchronous functions to communicate with your Deployd app.  </p>

<p>In <code>script.js</code>, add a <code>loadComments()</code> function inside of <code>$(document).ready</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function loadComments() {
    dpd.comments.get(function(comments, error) { //Use dpd.js to access the API
        $('#comments').empty(); //Empty the list
        comments.forEach(function(comment) { //Loop through the result
            addComment(comment); //Add it to the DOM.
        });
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>And call it when the page loads:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    loadComments();

    //...

});
</code></pre>

<p>If you run the app now, you should see the comments that you created in the Dashboard.</p>

<p>The <code>get()</code> function that makes this work sends an HTTP <code>GET</code> request to <code>/comments</code>, and returns an array of objects in the resource. There's nothing magical happening in dpd.js; you can use standard AJAX or HTTP requests if you prefer, or if you're unable to use dpd.js. (e.g. for mobile apps)</p>

<p><em>Note: If you haven't used AJAX much, note that all dpd.js functions are asynchronous and don't directly return a value.</em></p>

<pre><code>//Won't work: 
var comments = dpd.comments.get(); 
</code></pre>

<p>This means that your JavaScript will continue to execute and respond to user input while data is loading, which will make your app feel much faster to your users.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="s-Saving data-3475"></a><h3>Saving data <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Saving data-3475">#</a></h3>

<p>Notice that any comments you add through the app's form are still gone when you refresh. Let's make the form save comments to the database. </p>

<p>Delete these lines from <code>script.js</code> (near line 10, depending on where you put your <code>loadComments()</code> function):</p>

<pre><code>//Clear the form elements
$('#name').val('');
$('#comment').val('');

addComment({
    name: name,
    comment: comment
});
</code></pre>

<p>And replace them with: </p>

<pre><code>dpd.comments.post({
        name: name,
        comment: comment
}, function(comment, error) {
        if (error) return showError(error);

        addComment(comment);
        $('#name').val('');
        $('#comment').val('');
});
</code></pre>

<p>Add a utility function at the very top of <code>script.js</code> to alert any errors we get:</p>

<pre><code>function showError(error) {
        var message = "An error occurred";
        if (error.message) {
                message = error.message;
        } else if (error.errors) {
                var errors = error.errors;
                message = "";
                Object.keys(errors).forEach(function(k) {
                        message += k + ": " + errors[k] + "\n";
                });
        }

        alert(message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>An <code>error</code> object can include either a <code>message</code> property or an <code>errors</code> object containing validation errors. </p>

<p>If you load the page now, you should be able to submit a comment that appears even after you refresh.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="s-Conclusion-3475"></a><h3>Conclusion <a class="anchor-link" href="#s-Conclusion-3475">#</a></h3>

<p>In this tutorial, you saw how to create a simple app in Deployd. In the next part (coming soon), you'll see how to secure this app with Events.</p>

<p>The source code for this chapter includes a few extra features. If you're feeling adventurous, try adding them yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li>A refresh button that reloads the comments without refreshing the page</li>
<li>Edit and Delete links next to each comment. Hint: use the <code>put()</code> and <code>del()</code> functions from dpd.js.</li>
</ul>
