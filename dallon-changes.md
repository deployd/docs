Done:
- Made homepage calls to action smaller
- Added hierarchy lines to Table of Contents
- Remove "Docs" parent on table of contents (to show a stronger visual connection between the nav and the breadcrumbs)
- Remove "Docs" header on side nav (it's redundant and takes up a level)
- Show "doc" icons on the "Guides" page
- Rearrange "APIs" page
- Fix search typeahead flash
- Show real titles on table of contents (turned out to be a Windows bug)
- Made navigation and breadcrumbs more intuitive (in my opinion)

Want to do:

High level problems:
- It's not obvious that clicking into a parent page (i.e. Getting Started) takes me to the "All pages" view. I'm not sure what I'd expect, but not that. Maybe a table of contents?
- Clicking on a folder changes my navigation drastically and unexpectedly

Technical problems:
- The "All pages" view (i.e. Getting Started) shows the pages in a completely different order than is presented on the nav
